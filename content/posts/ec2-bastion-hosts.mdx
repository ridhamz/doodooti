  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
    In cloud infrastructure, <strong>security</strong> is essential, and a <strong>bastion host</strong> is key to keeping your private network safe. Acting as a secure gateway, it protects access to <strong>private resources</strong>. In this post, we’ll explore AWS EC2 bastion hosts, their role in <strong>network security</strong>, and the best ways to set them up for maximum security.
</p>

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <h3>What a Bastion Host Is and How It Works</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
      Simply put, a <strong>bastion host</strong> (also called a “jump box”) is
      a server specifically designed to provide{' '}
      <strong>secure, limited access</strong> to your private network. Instead
      of allowing direct access to your servers, which increases vulnerability,
      a bastion host acts as a go-between.
    </p>
  </div>

   <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
    Think of a <strong>bastion host</strong> as a secure gateway or checkpoint into your <strong>private network</strong>. It's an <strong>EC2 instance</strong> that sits in a <strong>public subnet</strong> and acts as the only entry point to your private EC2 instances. When you need to access a private server, you first <strong>SSH</strong> into the bastion host, and from there, you can SSH into your private servers. 
</p>
<p>
    Imagine a <strong>bastion host</strong> as a secure entry point to your <strong>private network</strong>. It’s an <strong>EC2 instance</strong> in a public subnet that acts as the only door to reach your private servers. If you need to access a server in the private network, you start by connecting to the bastion host, and then from there, you can connect to the private servers.
</p>

<p>
  The bastion host is set up with <strong>strict security rules</strong>,
  usually allowing only <strong>SSH</strong> access through{' '}
  <strong>port 22</strong> and accepting connections only from approved{' '}
  <strong>IP addresses</strong>, this way your <strong>private servers</strong>{' '}
  stay protected from the public internet, but authorized admins can still
  access them securely.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <h3>From Concept to Execution</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
      Throughout this post, I will guide you through the architecture outlined
      below in order to build a Bastion Host.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/2.png" />
</center>
<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
  <p>
    The idea is to provision <strong>two EC2 servers</strong> in a{' '}
    <strong>private subnet</strong> and another <strong>EC2 server</strong> in a{' '}
    <strong>public subnet</strong> to serve as a <strong>jump box</strong>. The{' '}
    <strong>jump box</strong> will allow the <strong>admin</strong> to securely
    access the <strong>private instances</strong> for{' '}
    <strong>configuration</strong> and other administrative tasks.
  </p>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <h3>Provision Resources</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
      I’ll use a CloudFormation template to set up the VPC, subnets, the
      internet gateway and route tables. For the EC2 instances, I’ll set them up
      through the AWS Console to make things easier to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, create a file named <strong>BastionHosts.yaml</strong> and start by
      adding the following code:
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'VPC with Public and Private Subnets'

Parameters:
  VpcCidr:
    Type: String
    Default: '10.0.0.0/16'
    Description: CIDR block for the VPC

  PublicSubnetCidr:
    Type: String
    Default: '10.0.1.0/24'
    Description: CIDR block for Public Subnet

  PrivateSubnetCidr:
    Type: String
    Default: '10.0.2.0/24'
    Description: CIDR block for Private Subnet
```

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
<p>This is the <strong>Parameters section</strong> of a <strong>CloudFormation template</strong>. 
It defines three parameters to configure the IP ranges for a VPC and its subnets:</p>

<ol>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>VpcCidr</strong>: Sets the IP range (CIDR block) for the entire VPC.
    Default Value: <code>10.0.0.0/16</code>
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PublicSubnetCidr</strong>: Sets the IP range for the public subnet.
    Default Value: <code>10.0.1.0/24</code>
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PrivateSubnetCidr</strong>: Sets the IP range for the private
    subnet. Default Value: <code>10.0.2.0/24</code>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These parameters make the VPC’s IP ranges easy 
to customize without changing the template code directly.</p>
<p>Next, we need to add the Resources section, which will define the logical 
resources that will become physical resources when the template is deployed.</p>
</div>

```yaml
Resources:
  # VPC
  MzVPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: !Ref VpcCidr
      EnableDnsHostnames: true
      EnableDnsSupport: true
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: Mz VPC

  # Internet Gateway
  InternetGateway:
    Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
    Properties:
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: Mz IGW

  AttachGateway:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref MzVPC
      InternetGatewayId: !Ref InternetGateway
```

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
<p>This section defines the <strong>resources</strong> that will be created when the CloudFormation template is deployed:</p>

<ol>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>MzVPC</strong>: Creates a <strong>VPC</strong> with the CIDR block
    provided by the <code>VpcCidr</code> parameter. It also enables DNS
    hostnames and support for DNS.
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>InternetGateway</strong>: Creates an{' '}
    <strong>Internet Gateway</strong> (IGW) to provide internet access to the
    VPC.
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>AttachGateway</strong>: Attaches the{' '}
    <strong>Internet Gateway</strong> to the <strong>VPC</strong> so that
    resources in the VPC can access the internet.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  These resources define the basic network infrastructure: a VPC, internet
  access, and the necessary connection between them.
</p>
</div>

```yaml
# Public Subnet
PublicSubnet:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
  Properties:
    VpcId: !Ref MzVPC
    CidrBlock: !Ref PublicSubnetCidr
    AvailabilityZone: !Select [0, !GetAZs '']
    MapPublicIpOnLaunch: true
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: Public Subnet

# Private Subnet
PrivateSubnet:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
  Properties:
    VpcId: !Ref MzVPC
    CidrBlock: !Ref PrivateSubnetCidr
    AvailabilityZone: !Select [0, !GetAZs '']
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: Private Subnet
```

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
<p>The code above defines the <strong>public subnet</strong> and <strong>private subnet</strong> that will be created in the VPC:</p>

<ol>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PublicSubnet</strong>: Creates a <strong>public subnet</strong>{' '}
    within the VPC using the CIDR block provided by the{' '}
    <code>PublicSubnetCidr</code> parameter. It is placed in the first available
    availability zone and enables public IP addresses for instances launched in
    this subnet.
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PrivateSubnet</strong>: Creates a <strong>private subnet</strong>{' '}
    within the VPC using the CIDR block provided by the{' '}
    <code>PrivateSubnetCidr</code> parameter. It is also placed in the first
    available availability zone, but it does not automatically assign public IPs
    to instances launched in this subnet.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  These subnets define the network layout: one for public-facing resources and
  one for private, internal resources.
</p>

</div>

```yaml
# Public Route Table
PublicRouteTable:
  Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
  Properties:
    VpcId: !Ref MzVPC
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: Public Route Table

PublicRoute:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Route
  DependsOn: AttachGateway
  Properties:
    RouteTableId: !Ref PublicRouteTable
    DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
    GatewayId: !Ref InternetGateway

PublicSubnetRouteTableAssociation:
  Type: AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation
  Properties:
    SubnetId: !Ref PublicSubnet
    RouteTableId: !Ref PublicRouteTable

# Private Route Table
PrivateRouteTable:
  Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
  Properties:
    VpcId: !Ref MzVPC
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: Private Route Table

PrivateSubnetRouteTableAssociation:
  Type: AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation
  Properties:
    SubnetId: !Ref PrivateSubnet
    RouteTableId: !Ref PrivateRouteTable
```

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
<p>The code above defines the route tables for both the <strong>public</strong> and <strong>private</strong> subnets, as well as the routes that connect them to the internet:</p>

<ol>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PublicRouteTable</strong>: Creates a <strong>route table</strong>{' '}
    for the public subnet and associates it with the VPC.
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PublicRoute</strong>: Defines the route for the public subnet,
    allowing traffic to the internet via the <strong>Internet Gateway</strong>.
    The route is set to <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>, meaning it allows all traffic to
    the internet.
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PublicSubnetRouteTableAssociation</strong>: Associates the public
    subnet with the <strong>public route table</strong> so that instances in the
    public subnet can route traffic to the internet.
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PrivateRouteTable</strong>: Creates a <strong>route table</strong>{' '}
    for the private subnet, again associating it with the VPC but without a
    direct route to the internet.
  </li>
  <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
    <strong>PrivateSubnetRouteTableAssociation</strong>: Associates the private
    subnet with the <strong>private route table</strong>, ensuring instances in
    the private subnet route traffic only internally.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  These route tables and associations ensure that the public subnet can access
  the internet while the private subnet remains isolated or has controlled
  access to the internet.
</p>
</div>

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
  <p>
    Now that our template is ready, let's deploy it using the CloudFormation
    service in the AWS Console UI. If you click the View in Infrastructure
    Composer button, you will see the infrastructure as code that we created, as
    represented in the image below
  </p>
</div>
<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/3.png" />
</center>

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
  <p>
    Now we're ready to proceed with deploying our template. Simply wait until
    the CloudFormation stack status updates to <strong>CREATE_COMPLETE</strong>
    .{' '}
  </p>
</div>

<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/18.png" />
  <small>Stack created successfully</small>
</center>

  <small>Our physical resources are now ready</small>
</center>

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
  <p>
    {' '}
    Now that our VPC architecture is ready, we can begin creating the EC2 instances
    to complete the Bastion Host setup.{' '}
  </p>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <h3>Provision The Bastian Host</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
      As mentioned in the previous section, I will use the Console UI to
      provision the EC2 instances. Go to the EC2 service, and click on Launch
      Instance to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      After entering the name and selecting the type for the EC2 instance, we
      need to specify a key pair to enable SSH access from our computer to the
      Bastion Host.
    </p>
    <center>
      <img
        src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/7.png"
        style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}
      />
    </center>
    <p style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
      If you don't already have a key pair, simply click on the Create new key
      pair button
    </p>
    <center>
      <center>
        <img
          src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/5.png"
          style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}
        />
      </center>
    </center>
    <p style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
      Under the network settings, we need to select the VPC we created and the
      public subnet, as the jump box needs to be located in the public subnet
    </p>
    <center>
      <img
        src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/8.png"
        style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}
      />
    </center>
    <p style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
      The final step is to set the security group, we will create a new one and
      allow SSH connections from anywhere
    </p>
    <center>
      <img
        src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/9.png"
        style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}
      />
    </center>
    <p style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
      <b>Note:</b> We can specify a specific CIDR IP block in the source of the
      security group for better security, but for the purposes of this post, we
      will allow access from anywhere.
    </p>
    <p style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
      After that, click on the Launch Instance button and wait for the EC2
      instance to be provisioned. Once the instance is running, go to the
      Instance Details section to verify the Public IP other configurations.
    </p>
    <center>

    </center>
  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <h4>SSH the Bastian Host</h4>
  <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
      In my case, the public IP address for the Bastion Host is "35.91.217.143,"
      and the key name is "MZ-Bastina-Host-Key.pem", so to establish an SSH
      connection, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
        <strong>Open the terminal</strong>: Navigate to the folder where you
        downloaded the key pair.
      </li>
      <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
        <strong>Change the permissions for the key pair</strong>: Type the
        following command in the terminal:
        <br />
        <code>chmod 400 "MZ-Bastina-Host-Key.pem"</code>
      </li>
      <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
        <strong>Copy the public IP address</strong>: Copy the public IP address
        of the Bastion Host.
      </li>
      <li style={{ marginTop: '5px' }}>
        <strong>Run the SSH command</strong>: Run the following SSH command to
        connect:
        <br />
        <code>ssh -i .\MZ-Bastina-Host-Key.pem ec2-user@35.91.217.143</code>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>
<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/10.png" />

  <small>Successfully connected to the Jump Box 🥳</small>
</center>

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <h3>Provision The Private Instances</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
      The steps to provision the private instances, <strong>Server 1</strong>{' '}
      and <strong>Server 2</strong>, are the same as those for the{' '}
      <strong>Bastion Host</strong> instance. The only difference is in the{' '}
      <strong>Network settings</strong>, as these instances are{' '}
      <strong>private</strong> and need to be located in the{' '}
      <strong>private subnet</strong> without enabling the{' '}
      <strong>Auto-assign public IP</strong> option.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/12.png" />
</center>

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
  <p>
    About the <strong>security group</strong>, it will be different because we
    need to allow <strong>SSH access</strong> only from the{' '}
    <strong>Jump Box</strong>. We can do this by changing the{' '}
    <strong>source type</strong> to <strong>custom</strong>, then selecting the{' '}
    <strong>security group</strong> of the Jump Box as the source.
  </p>
</div>
<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/13.png" />
</center>
<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
  <p>
    Now that our three <strong>instances</strong> are running, it's time to test
    the <strong>connectivity</strong> from the <strong>Jump Box</strong> to the
    private instances, <strong>Server 1</strong> and <strong>Server 2</strong>.
  </p>
</div>
<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/14.png" />
</center>
<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
  <p>
    In order to do an SSH connection from our Bastion Host to the private
    servers, we first need to upload the key pairs of Server 1 and Server 2 to
    the Bastion Host and we can use the <strong>scp</strong> command.
  </p>
</div>
<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/15.png" />
</center>

<div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
  <p>
    Now, let's try to make the SSH connection from the jump box. For that, we
    need to use the private IPs of Server 1 (ip: 10.0.2.252) and Server 2 (ip:
    10.0.2.164).
  </p>
</div>
<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/16.png" />
  <small>Successfully connected to the Server 1 🥳</small>
</center>

<center>
  <img src="/images/posts/aws-bastian-host/17.png" />
  <small>Successfully connected to the Server 2 🥳</small>
</center>

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: '5px' }}>
    <p>
      In summary, setting up a Bastion Host is a key step in building secure
      access points within your AWS environment. By carefully configuring
      networking, security groups, and SSH keys, we’ve established a secure
      gateway that allows controlled access to private instances. This setup
      enhances security by isolating access to sensitive resources, while also
      simplifying management and reducing potential vulnerabilities.
