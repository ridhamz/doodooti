  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
    AWS is a global cloud platform powered by a global infrastructure that
    consists of a network of data centers and facilities around the world.
    <p>
      AWS provides cloud computing services to millions of customers, and its
      global infrastructure is designed to ensure high availability,
      reliability, and low-latency access to its services.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
  <h3>Components</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
    There are four key components that form the backbone of the AWS global
    infrastructure:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Regions</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Availability Zones</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Edge Locations</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Zones</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
  <h3>Regions</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
    A region is a geographical area where AWS has established a presence to host its cloud computing services. Each AWS region is essentially a separate and independent data center infrastructure, strategically located around the world.
  </div>

<div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
  With this separation, cloud architects have the ability to design highly
  available applications that operate across multiple regions. In the event of a
  specific region experiencing downtime, the applications remain functional
  because the operations in the unaffected region are not impacted by the issues
  in the downed region. This approach enhances resilience and ensures continuous
  service availability, reinforcing the robustness of the overall architecture.

<div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
  Regions exist around the world, providing businesses with the opportunity to
  deploy their applications and solutions in the closest geographical proximity
  to their customers. This strategic placement facilitates low-latency access,
  contributing to improved application performance and a more responsive user
  experience. By leveraging AWS regions, businesses can optimize the
  geographical distribution of their resources, ensuring efficient delivery of
  services and minimizing the time it takes for data to travel between end-users
  and the deployed infrastructure.
</div>

  <div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
    AWS presently operates 33 regions globally, each distinguished by a unique name and code. 
    Additionally, they have plans to launch an additional 6 regions in the near future.

  </div>

  <div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
    When interacting with an AWS service, your actions are confined to a designated region.
     For example, if you wish to provision an EC2 instance (a virtual machine), 
     you must select a specific region, as an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) 
     region is distinct from an EC2 instance in the eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) region.
    Some services do not necessitate the selection of a specific region
     these are referred to as global services.
  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
  <h3>Avalabilty Zone</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
    <p>
      Each AWS region comprises a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs) and
      may extend to include four, five, or six AZs. These Availability Zones are
      meticulously separated, ensuring that the failure of a specific AZ does
      not impact the functionality of the others. They are interconnected
      through high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, further enhancing the
      overall reliability and resilience of the infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p
      style={{
        marginTop: "5px",
      }}
    >
      AWS does not explicitly disclose the composition of an Availability Zone
      (AZ), but it can be either a single data center or multiple data centers.
    </p>
    <p style={{ marginTop: "5px" }}>
      In the context of the earlier example, when provisioning an EC2 instance,
      we must also select a specific Availability Zone (AZ) inside the region
      since an EC2 instance operates exclusively within a single AZ.
    </p>
    <p style={{ marginTop: "5px" }}>
      Additionally, since EC2 is a private service, it operates only from a
      Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). A VPC represents a secluded cloud network
      segmented into subnets, which can be classified as either private or
      public. Explicit configuration is essential to facilitate communication
      between the internet and any resource provisioned within the VPC.
    </p>

      <h5>The final architecture:</h5>
      <img src="/images/posts/aws-global/3.png" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
  <h3>Edge locations</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
    <p>
      Edge locations are AWS data centers designed to deliver services with the
      lowest latency possible. Amazon has dozens of these data centers spread
      across the world. They’re closer to users than Regions or Availability
      Zones, often in major cities, so responses can be fast and snappy.
    </p>
    <div style={{ marginTop: "5px" }}>
      Edge locations are used for a number of AWS features like{" "}
      <b>CloudFront</b> and
      <b>AWS Global Accelerator</b>
      <p style={{ marginTop: "5px" }}>
        <h5>CloudFront</h5>
        CloudFront is the most commonly discussed use of edge locations. It’s a content
        delivery network that caches content in edge locations. Content can be served
        directly from the cache, so it gets to users faster. CloudFront is often
        used to serve static assets, speed up websites, and stream video.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/posts/aws-global/4.png" />
      <p>
        Notice that there are two types of <b>Edge Locations</b> local edges and
        regional edges. This mechanism operates by first checking the local
        edge. If there's a hit, the request is immediately returned. Otherwise,
        it checks the closest regional edges. If cached data exists, it is
        returned to the user. If not, the regional edge retrieves the data from
        the original source such as S3 and this done via <b>CloudFront</b>,
        returns it, and caches it for future requests.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: "5px" }}>
        <h5>AWS Global Accelerator</h5>
        AWS Global Accelerator allows you to route requests for key resources through
        Amazon’s global network—even if the request is going halfway round the world.
        The request is initially routed to the closest edge location and then travels
        through Amazon’s network—often with lower latency and higher throughput than
        the public internet.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/posts/aws-global/6.png" />
      <p style={{ marginTop: "5px" }}>
        Note: you can’t run your workloads directly in edge locations, they’re
        only used by Amazon’s managed services.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
  <h3>Local zones</h3>
  <div style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
    <p style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
      Local Zones are an infrastructure deployment concept from Amazon Web
      Services (AWS) designed to bring AWS services closer to a specific
      geographic area, providing users with low-latency access to resources and
      applications.
    </p>
    <p style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
      Local Zones are an extension of the main AWS Regions and are ideal for
      latency-sensitive workloads or applications that require real-time
      processing.
    </p>
    <p style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
      These zones are often situated in large metropolitan areas and provide a
      selection of AWS services, including Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2),
      Relational Database Service (RDS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
      (EKS), among others. By deploying resources in a Local Zone, customers can
      reduce latency for end-users in that particular location, improving
      application performance and responsiveness.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/posts/aws-global/5.png" />
    In the example above, we observe the provisioning of an EC2 instance within
    a local zone. Notably, the VPC demonstrates the capability to extend
    seamlessly from the <b>region</b> into the <b>local zone</b>. This
    integration showcases the flexibility and continuity of the Virtual Private
    Cloud (VPC) architecture, allowing resources to span across both the AZ and
    its associated local zone
